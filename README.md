# Python-lookup
This is a repository of my python plays and is PERMANENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION. 

Current code examples:
* Monty Hall original + extended
* image angle measure
* Twan dice game (greedy player + sensible player)
* List sorting bonanza (brute force + bubble + quick)
* Fibonacci, FizzBuzz, cashier problem

Someday I will populate it with some more contemporary code examples. It is just a collection of code that I used a long time ago to check some fun cases of code-solvable problems.
